## Week 1: Potential Outcomes Notation and Treatment Estimators

Exercises:
- Understand the difference between the ATE and ATT using a simulated job training program among a population of bankers and doctors.
- Provide intuition for sources of bias in the simple difference in means estimate of the ATE. Adapted from Section 4.1.3 of Scott Cunningham's [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/potential-outcomes.html#simple-difference-in-means-decomposition).
