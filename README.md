## Week 1: Potential Outcomes Notation and Treatment Estimators

Exercises:
- Understand the difference between the ATE and ATT using a simulated job training program among a population of bankers and doctors.
- Provide intuition for sources of bias in the simple difference in means estimate of the ATE. Adapted from Section 4.1.3 of Scott Cunningham's [Causal Inference: The Mixtape](https://mixtape.scunning.com/potential-outcomes.html#simple-difference-in-means-decomposition).

## Week 2: The Conditional Expectation Function and Linear Regression

Exercises: 
- Estimate the gender gap in earnings using the CEF and linear regression. Why are these the same or different?
- Estimate the relationship between earnings and hours worked using the CEF and linear regression. Why are these the same or different?
